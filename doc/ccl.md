# Clozure Common Lisp: Usage and Notes

The CCL bindings comprise two files:

- [uhppoted.lisp](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-dll/blob/master/bindings/ccl/uhppoted.lisp)
- [packages.lisp](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-dll/blob/master/bindings/ccl/packages.lisp)
 
Copy these to wherever makes it sense in your project. 

The generated DLL (Windows), shared lib (Linux) or dylib (MacOS) should be placed in either the library search path for the platform:
- LD_LIBRARY (Linux)
- DYLIB_LIBRARY (MacOS)
- Windows - see [Dynamic-Link Library Search Order](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order)

or in the same folder as the executable.

Examples illustrating the use of the CCL API can be found in the [examples/ccl](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-dll/tree/master/examples/ccl) folder.

## API

API functions are invoked indirectly via the `uhppoted` function which (optionally) takes the additional
information required to access a controller, e.g.:

```
(uhppoted f 
          :bind-addr      "0.0.0.0"
          :broadcast-addr "255.255.255.255"
          :listen-addr    "0.0.0.0:60001"
          :timeout        2500
          :controllers    (list '(405419896 "192.168.1.100" "tcp") '(303986753 "192.168.1.100"))
          :debug          T)))

bind-addr        IPv4 address:port to which to bind the UDP socket. Defaults to 0.0.0.0:0
broadcast-addr   IPv4 address:port for broadcast UDP packets. Defaults to 255.255.255.255:60000
listen-addr      IPv4 address:port for events from controller (unused). Defaults to 0.0.0.0:60001
timeout          milliseconds to wait for a reply. Defaults to 5 seconds.
controllers      Optional list of specific controllers and their associated IPv4 addresses (e.g.for controllers
                 located on a different interface, a VLAN or a VPN)
debug            Displays the DLL and controller requests/responses if true.
```

Each controller is tuple of the form `(id address transport)`. - the _transport_ field is optional, with valid values "udp" or "tcp"
and defaulting to "udp" if the value is not provided.

All API functions raise a `uhppoted-error` _condition_ if the call fails for any reason whatsoever:
```
(define-condition uhppoted-error (error)
  ((message :initarg :message :reader message)))
```

Restart cases are defined for `ignore`, `use-value` and `with-warning`:
...
          (restart-case (funcall f uhppote)
                  (ignore       ()      nil)
                    (use-value    (value) value)
                    (with-warning (err)   (warn err)))

```

For example:
```
  (handler-bind
   ((uhppoted-error
     #'(lambda (c) 
        (format t "~%*** ERROR: ~a~%~%" (uhppoted:message c))
        (invoke-restart 'ignore))))
  (uhppoted f 
            :bind-addr      "0.0.0.0"
            ...
```

### `lookup`

The `lookup` function provides text equivalents to the following byte codes:
- door control mode
- event type
- event reason
- event direction

```
(defun uhppoted-lookup (category code locale) ...)
