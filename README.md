## Release Notes

The releases do not include binaries - cross-compiling a DLL/shared-lib is not straightforward because
the _cgo_ compiler links in a platfrom specific version of _glibc_. Building the DLL/shared-lib 
is straightforward (see below) and only requires that _go_ and _cgo_ are installed on the system.

### Current Release

**[v0.8.8](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-dll/releases/tag/v0.8.8) - 2024-03-27**

1. Implemented `restore-default-parameters` function to reset a controller to the manufacturer default configuration.
2. Bumped Go version to 1.22.


## Installation

Requirements:
- Go v1.21+
- (Windows only) _mingw_
- (optional) make

The DLL/shared lib/dylib has to be built from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-dll.git
cd uhppoted-dll
make build
```

If you prefer to build manually:
```
   git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-dll.git
   cd uhppoted-dll
   go build -trimpath -buildmode=c-shared -o <lib> go/devices.go go/cards.go go/events.go go/time_profiles.go go/tasks.go go/main.go 
```

_NOTE_: The list of source files is required pending a fix for [cmd/cgo: inconsistent compiler behaviour when compiling a C.struct](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52611#issuecomment-1120322135)_

Copy the generated DLL (Windows), shared lib (Linux) or dylib (MacOS) to the library search path for the platform:
- LD_LIBRARY (Linux)
- DYLIB_LIBRARY (MacOS)
- Windows - see [Dynamic-Link Library Search Order](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order)
- (OR) to the same folder as the project executable.

The usage for the language specfic bindings are described in their own documents:
- [C](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-dll/blob/main/doc/C.md)
- [C++](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-dll/blob/main/doc/C.md)
- [C#](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-dll/blob/main/doc/csharp.md)
- [Python](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-dll/blob/main/doc/python.md))
- [Clozure Common Lisp](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-dll/blob/main/doc/ccl.md))


### `debug` lib

The `debug` shared-lib/DLL displays the parameters with which the function was invoked. It _fakes_ the call
to the real controller, returning a plausible response instead.

### `test` lib

The `test` shared-lib/DLL is included for integration testing and validates that the parameters with which a 
function is invoked match expected values. As with the `debug` lib, it does not access a real controller and
returns a fixed response.

#### `GetDevices`

Retrieves a list of all UHPPOTE controllers that respond to a broadcast `get-device` request.

#### `GetDevice`

Retrieves the controller information for a specific UHPPOTE controller from the response to a `get-device` request. 

#### `SetAddress`

Sets the IPv4 address, subnet mask and gateway address for a controller.

#### `GetListener`

Retrieves the IPv4 address of the host configured to receive events from the controller.

#### `SetListener`

Sets the IPv4 address of the host to receive events from the controller.

#### `GetTime`

Retrieves the controller date and time.

#### `SetTime`

Sets the controller date and time.

#### `GetDoorControlState`

Retrieves a door control state (`normally open`, `normally closed` or `controlled`) from the controller.

#### `SetDoorControlState`

Sets a door control state (`normally open`, `normally closed` or `controlled`) on the controller.

#### `OpenDoor`

Unlocks a door remotely.

#### `GetStatus`

Retrieves the controller current status. 

The controller status includes the most recently logged event but if the controller has no events
the `Event` field will have an index of 0 and all the other fields will be invalid.

#### `GetCards`

Retrieves the number of cards stored on a controller.

#### `GetCard`

Retrieves a stored card's information using the card number.

#### `GetCardByIndex`

Retrieves a stored card's information using an index into the card list.

#### `PutCard`

Adds or updates a card record on the controller.

Note:
    The UHPPOTE access controller has a weird behaviour around the PIN field. According to the SDK 
    documentation, valid PINs are in the range 0 to 999999. However the controller will accept a 
    PIN number out of that range and only keep the lower 7 nibbles of the 32-bit unsigned value.
    e.g:

    | PIN     | Hex value | Stored as (hex) | Retrieved as (hex) | Retrieved as (decimal) |
    |---------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------|
    | 0       | 0x000000  | 0x000000        | 0x000000           | 0                      |
    | 999999  | 0x0f423f  | 0x0f423f        | 0x0f423f           | 999999                 |
    | 1000000 | 0x0f4240  | 0x000000        | 0x000000           | 0                      |
    | 1000001 | 0x0f4241  | 0x000000        | 0x000000           | 0                      |
    | 1048576 | 0x100000  | 0x000000        | 0x000000           | 0                      |
    | 1048577 | 0x100001  | 0x000000        | 0x000001           | 1                      |
    | 1999999 | 0x1E847F  | 0x0E847F        | 0x000001           | 951423                 |

    Like the _uhppote-core_ `put-card` implementation, the DLL implemenation returns an error 
    for an out of range PIN.

#### `DeleteCard`

Deletes a card record from the controller.

#### `DeleteCards`

Deletes all card records from the controller.

#### `GetEvent`

Retrieves a single stored event (by index) from the controller.

#### `GetEventIndex`

Retrieves the current value of the controller event index (typically used as a marker for events
that have been retrieved).

#### `SetEventIndex`

Sets the current value of the controller event index (typically used to update the marker for events
that have been retrieved).

#### `RecordSpecialEvents`

Enables or disables the door and relay events on a controller. 

#### `GetTimeProfile`

Retrieves a numbered time profile from the controller.

#### `SetTimeProfile`

Adds or updates a numbered time profile on the controller.

#### `ClearTimeProfiles`

Deletes all stored time profiles from a controller.

#### `ClearTaskList`

Clears the scheduled task list on a specific UHPPOTE controller, preparatory to using `AddTask` and `RefreshTask`. 

#### `AddTask`

Adds a scheduled task to the task list on a specific UHPPOTE controller. The task is not activated until `RefreshTaskList` is invoked. `ClearTaskList` should have been invoked prior to invoking a sequence of `AddTask` invocations to put the task list in a known state.

#### `RefreshTaskList`

Activates all tasks added by `AddTask`.

#### `SetPCCotrol`

Enables or disables remote host access control. 

If remote host access control is enabled, the access controller expects the host to communicate at least
once every 30 seconds otherwise it reverts to local control of access using the stored list of cards (the
communication is not required to be a 'set-pc-control' command - any command is sufficient). If the access
controller has reverted to local control because no message has been received from the host for more than
30 seconds, any subsequent communication from the remote host will re-establish remote control mode again.

#### `SetInterlock`

Sets a controller door interlock. 

The door interlock prevents a door from opening unless the interlock condition is valid for that door. The API takes
a byte value as the interlock mode, corresponding to one of the following modes:

| Value | Mode    | Description                                                                                                     |
|-------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | none    | Any door can opened subject to access restrictions                                                              |
| 1     | 1&2     | Door 1 can be opened if 2 is closed and vice versa, doors 3 and 4 are not interlocked                           |
| 2     | 3&4     | Door 3 can be opened if 4 is closed and vice versa, doors 1 and 2 are not interlocked                           |
| 3     | 1&2,3&4 | Door 1 can be opened if 2 is closed and vice versa. Door 3 can be opened if 4 is closed (and vice versa)        |
| 4     | 1&2&3   | Door 1 can be opened if 2 and 3 are both closed, door 2 if 1 and 3 are closed and door 3 if 1 and 2 are closed  |
| 8     | 1&2&3&4 | A door can only be opened if all the other doors are closed                                                     |


#### `ActivateKeypads`

Activates and deactivates a controller reader access keypads. 

Note that the controllers do not provide the capability for activating or deactivating individual keypads.


#### `SetDoorPasscodes`

Sets up to four supervisor passcodes to allow keypad only access to a door.


#### `RestoreDefaultParameters`

Resets a controller to the manufacturer default configuration.


#### `ListenEvents`

Listens for controller events and forwards received events to a callback function for processing by the
application.
